# Heat-Detection-System
Welcome to the Heat Stroke Detection System repository. This project was created to provide a solution for monitoring temperature in a user-friendly manner, especially designed with the elderly in mind. We utilized the Nucleo-64 STM32 microcontroller and various hardware components, including Breadboard, LED Bulbs, Sound, and Temperature Sensors, to build an efficient and accessible system.

<h2>Features</h2> 

**User-Friendly Design:** The system is tailored to be easy to use, making it ideal for the elderly.
**Alert System:** Uses LED bulbs and sound to notify users of temperature changes.
**Efficient Development:** We followed a structured approach, incorporating TinkerCad simulations, Gantt Charts, and S.M.A.R.T. Goals to ensure a timely and successful project completion.
